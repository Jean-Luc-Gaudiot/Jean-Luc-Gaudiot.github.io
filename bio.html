        <h3 style="font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 8px">Biography</h3>
        <p>I currently hold the position of Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at
            the University of California, Irvine, where I previously served as Department Chair for six years. During
            my tenure, I oversaw substantial growth and advancement, such as the hiring of twelve new faculty members
            (three senior professors including one member of the National Academy of Engineering). I also played
            a pivotal role in significantly elevating the US News and World Report® rankings of both the
            Computer Engineering program and the Electrical Engineering program. Prior to this, I held
            the position of Professor at the University of Southern California. My academic journey
            includes earning a PhD in Computer Science from UCLA in 1982. </p>
        <p>I was 2017 IEEE Computer Society President. This was a tumultuous time as the Computer Society was faced with
            a major deficit. I initiated an intense year of reforms ranging from operations to budget issues, leading to
            a solid, sustainable financial situation on which subsequent presidents were able to build. Throughout my
            term, I spearheaded numerous reforms, addressing operational and budgetary concerns, resulting in a marked
            improvement in the Society's financial standing. I also launched initiatives in emerging technologies such
            as Cybersecurity and Blockchain, while prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and expanding
            the Society's global reach. Moreover, I held editorial positions in various IEEE journals and played
            leadership roles in numerous conferences.
        </p>
        <p>I have long been committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) both within the IEEE Computer
            Society and at my home institution. At UC Irvine, I served as the EECS DECADE Mentor from 2020 to 2022,
            where I actively contributed to fostering a diverse and inclusive educational environment for doctoral and
            terminal M.A. students. Furthermore, my expertise in technology forecasting, particularly in <em>Predictions
                2024</em> and <em>2023 International Roadmap for Devices and Systems</em>, underscores my
            commitment to advancing cutting-edge research in the field.</p>
        <p>My extensive contributions to the field of electrical engineering and computer science, spanning areas such
            as multiprocessor architecture, autonomous driving systems, and hardware security, are reflected in over 300
            articles and books. My research endeavors have been supported by prestigious organizations including NSF,
            DoE, DARPA, and various industrial partners. I am honored to hold Fellow status in both IEEE and AAAS, as
            well as being recognized as an IFIP Silver Core Member and a Professional Member of Eta Kappa Nu.</p>
