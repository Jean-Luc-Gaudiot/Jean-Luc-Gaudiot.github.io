Jean-Luc is someone who has made profound contributions to our field of research and to our community. His research interests span a broad spectrum including parallel processing and computer architecture, which I am most familiar with. He is one of the most distinguished researchers in our community with hundreds of publications and over thirty Ph.D. students graduated. He has also organized multiple conferences and served as editor of various journals. I am most grateful for him helping me and some colleagues to improve the quality and reach of SBAC-PAD, a computer architecture conference that started as a Brazilian event and is now an IEEE international conference.
