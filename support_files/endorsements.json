The candidate must be knowledgeable on IEEE issues, and deep understanding of the mechanisms available within IEEE to deal with them. Jean-Luc has served in many key positions in IEEE for many years, including President of the Computer Society, which makes him exceptionally knowledgeable where it counts. The candidate must be genuinely fair minded. Anyone who knows Jean-Luc knows he gets high marks on this. Finally, the candidate must enjoy performing the service that being a Division Director will entail. Jean-Luc has demonstrated that commitment to service in every IEEE role he has assumed. Bottom line: It is a pleasure to endorse his candidacy for Division Director with no reservations whatsoever. In my view, IEEE would be lucky to have Jean-Luc in that role."

Secondly, when voting on any agenda item, the Division Director should vote in the best interest of IEEE even when consequences to the Computer Society is not optimal. As Computer Society President, Jean-Luc made impactful cost cutting decisions. He supported the financial transparency initiative which reduced the IEEE indirect charges to the Computer Society. These challenging and difficult decisions combined with cost reduction decisions of prior Computer Presidents brought the Computer Society back to a positive financial status. A Division Director must not be influenced by regional or special interest groups but always consider what best for IEEE. These are the values that I see in Jean-Luc and thus my endorsement for him as the Computer Society Division Director position."

In particular, in his long-time services to IEEE members, Professor Gaudiot has shown unique leadership and adaptivity in handling difficult problems during our changing time. He has my most enthusiastic endorsement for IEEE Division Director."

His tenure as President of the Computer Society was quite successful, leading us to a better financial situation, new products and improved links with India and other developing counties. During his tenure as Chair of IEEE Technical Committee of Computer Architecture, he founded have IEEE Computer Architecture Letters, which has now become a major publication of the Computer Society. Earlier he has served as conference organizer, Program Committee chair, Editor-in-Chief of flagship titles in the Computer Society portfolio of publications. His contributions to the community is unparalleled. He has been clearly a successful and effective leader with a powerful long range vision. I cannot think of a colleague who is more qualified to lead Division V."

He is an accomplished academic, well recognized for his many teaching, research and administrative/leadership contributions. He also has a long demonstrated record of passionate and dedicated volunteer contributions, in particular for the IEEE and the IEEE Computer Society. In his former roles he has shown to be generous and considerate of different values and perspectives. JL Gaudiot not only brings an academic perspective, from his past experiences, he is readily capable of bringing the industry perspective and understanding. Towards reaching the IEEE goals, he will bring people skills to the mix of his competencies and experiences. I cannot think of a better candidate for the role of Division V Director than JL Gaudiot. I enthusiastically endorse his candidacy!"
