        <h3 style="font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 8px"><strong>Why I Am Running for IEEE Computer Society Division Director and Seek Your Support</strong></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25em; margin-bottom: 1px"><strong> As IEEE Division Director, representing Computer Society, I will strive to significantly expand our impact
            in three key areas:</strong></p>
        <div class="goals" id="goals" style="margin-bottom: 1px; margin-top: 1px">
            <ul style="margin-block-start: 1px;margin-block-end: 1px">
                <li><strong>Technical Relevance</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Diversity</strong> and <strong>Geographic Representation</strong><br></li>
                <li><strong>Grassroots Activities</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1px; margin-top: 1px" class="lastLine" id="lastLine">That is why I am running for <strong>Division Director</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>My focus as Division Director will be on fostering open communities, ensuring the seamless
            flow of information, responding to the evolving needs of our members, and, most
            importantly, promoting inclusivity across all fronts. These principles have guided my long
            and distinguished service to the IEEE Computer Society, and with your support, I will
            continue to champion them as IEEE Division Director.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25em"><strong>My priorities</strong></p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><strong><em>Anticipating and Leveraging Emerging Technologies:</em></strong><br>
                I will continue our efforts in technology forecasting, utilizing IEEE’s resources to identify
                and support strategic, transformative technologies such as autonomous systems, green
                technologies, AI, and quantum computing. This includes supporting new developments
                and disseminating crucial information through interactive video, immersive
                technologies, and tech briefs that keep our members at the forefront of innovation.
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>Strengthening Inter-Unit Collaboration:</em></strong><br>
                I will enhance communication and coordination between the Computer Society and
                other IEEE units, focusing on strategies for membership growth through cross-society
                collaboration.
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>Expanding Engagement and Outreach:</em></strong><br>
                I will explore innovative ways to engage our diverse membership, particularly by
                extending outreach to underrepresented groups, students, and seasoned professionals.
                A key focus will be adapting our offerings to meet the geographic diversity of our
                members.
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>Harnessing New Tools for Technical Information Delivery:</em></strong><br>
                I will implement new tools and technologies to make technical information more
                accessible. This includes exploring opportunities for new product development, such as
                hybrid conferences and Open Access publications, and leveraging advancements in AI-
                based technologies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> As a skilled leader, <strong>I will work to unify emerging opportunities</strong> into a coherent, viable
            vision
            for the future. I will prioritize supporting Societies, Councils, Chapters, and Student
            Chapters—the core of IEEE. Recognizing that innovation often grows from grassroots
            efforts, I will <strong>encourage these groups to explore and establish new activities</strong>, develop new
            products, and disseminate technical information as widely as possible.</p>
        <p> I will also <strong>focus on breaking down traditional silos</strong>, fostering interaction among members
            through multi-society memberships, interdisciplinary events, and modern communication
            platforms. This will help us create new, innovative ways to connect and collaborate.</p>
        <p> While our hallmark services—transactions, magazines, standards, and conferences—remain
            central to our mission, I will actively <strong>promote the Open Access publication mandate </strong> to
            keep us competitive in the ever-evolving publication landscape.
        </p>
        <p> My overarching goal is to continue <strong>fostering a demographically diverse and inclusive
            membership</strong> within the Computer Society, beginning at the grassroots level. Now, more
            than ever, we need to nurture volunteer-based, grassroots activities that address the needs
            of our members.</p>
        <p>Division Directors play essential roles in IEEE governance. The Division V Director, one of
            two directors elected by the Computer Society membership, represents the interests of the
            Computer Society and its members within the larger IEEE organization (more details
            <a data-fr-linked="true"
               href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/election/position-division-delegate-director.pdf">here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>In summary, my vision for this role is rooted in inclusivity across demographics, geography,
            and technical disciplines. With rapid technological advancements, changing information
            dissemination methods, and evolving member demographics and needs, IEEE faces
            significant challenges and opportunities for transformation. My experience and insight will
            be invaluable in navigating these challenges and seizing the opportunities they present. </p>
        <p><strong><em>I respectfully ask for your vote to help lead IEEE-CS into a promising future that benefits
            you and all our fellow members and advances humanity by leveraging technology</em></strong>.</p>
